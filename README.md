# Caelestes' pycan-2
A prequel to my pycan project, now with less spaghetti code and higher performance! I am learning ^^

## Scope
This software is built for use in CanSat-type high-altitude-balloon, sounding-rocket or drone experiments, featuring an RP2040 microcontoller, a Bosch BMP 280 pressure sensor, an MPU6050/GY-86 IMU and additional scientific sensor payload.
